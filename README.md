# Hack-The-6ix
Project for Hack The 6ix

MediFly allows the user to request for emergency help or medication such as an Epipen and Epinephrine. First you download the MediFly app and request a personal account from your local hospital. Then you can log into your account and use the features when necessary. If you are in an emergency, press the "EMERGENCY" button and a list of common medication or a first aid kit are options for the person to pick from. Once a choice is selected the local hospital will see the request and deploy the medication to the person and human first responders will be called. The drone will have a GPS tracker on it and have a GPS location of the person it needs to sent the medication to. When the drone arrives a message is sent to the person. A camera will use facial recognition to confirm the correct person and open the holding compartment so the person can take their medication.
